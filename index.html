          I have always had big dreams. That inner sense that something about me
          was special. Like I was going to be someone that mattered in the
          world. This delusion starkly contradicts everything I believe in. I
          don’t believe in destiny or fate or that things happen for a reason. I
          think that your life is determined by two things: the actions you
          take, and the natural randomness of the universe or what some people
          like to call luck. Some people think they are successful because some
          external force is supporting them. Like they are some sort of chosen
          one. A messiah. A prophet. Others attribute their success to pure hard
          work and resilience. If you try to convince them that luck is involved
          they would deny it and make snarky remarks about how luck is a way
          people make themselves feel better about their own failures. Denying
          the existence of luck or as I like to call it RNG (short for randomly
          generated number a more relatable term to the computer age we live in)
          to me is more bizarre than denying the existence of god. If you give
          me 5 minutes and a piece of paper I can probably list 10 clear pieces
          of evidence that support the existence of RNG. In contrast if you give
          a theist a millenia and all the paper that can be made if we cut the
          entire Amazon rainforest they would still have a hard time convincing
          somebody that god actually exists let alone give a single clear piece
          of evidence. Every single time a cell divides you are playing russian
          roulette on whether that cell becomes cancerous or not and whether
          your own immune system which you have zero control over is able to
          recognize the danger of that cancerous cell or not. At any random
          moment in time any random cell can become a malignant cell and if your
          immune system fails to recognize the danger of that cell you are
          likely to develop cancer. Every time you step into your car you are at
          risk of getting into a fatal accident. These are what I like to call
          terminal RNG. It is the type of bad RNG that you have no control over.
          You could waste your life worrying about this type of RNG and it will
          ruin your life. On the other hand there is a type of RNG that is less
          terminal. A type that you can actually fight back against. For
          example, being born poor, having abusive parents, developing a chronic
          disease like diabetes. These types of bad RNG will still make your
          life harder but they don’t make it impossible to succeed. It is often
          these types of RNG that successful people quote having to tell people
          that they weren’t lucky. The football star forgets that he could have
          been born without feet. The gorgeous actress forgets that hard work
          didn’t give her that beautiful face. No matter how much work you do,
          if you don’t have the right RNG, it is impossible to be successful.
          The success equation = RNG x Work. Now this whole time I was trying to
          convince you that you have no control over your RNG but that is not
          true. In fact RNG is not a single constant for every area of your
          life. You might be ugly but intelligent. You might lack athletic
          abilities but have an artistic mind. This variability is very
          important because if you play to your strength you will maximize your
          chances of success. In order to get the highest chance of success one
          must focus on maximizing both sides of the equation. If you get stuck
          spending your time and energy on something that you lack the natural
          ability to do, your chances of success will still be low despite your
          hard work. You might end up being one of those people calling other
          successful people lucky and denying that hard work matters. Both this
          type of person and the type I described as denying that luck matters
          are wrong. Because they are both part of the success equation and if
          you neglect either of them you are doing yourself a disservice and
          decreasing your chances of success dramatically.
